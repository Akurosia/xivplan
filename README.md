# Final Fantasy XIV Raid Planner

This is a tool for quickly diagramming raid strategies for Final Fantasy XIV,
inspired by https://raidplan.io.

Or at least it will be. Right now, it doesn't do much.

Check out https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space if you need something more powerful.
I'm creating this because the toolbox Strat Maker is too cumbersome to use during
progression, so it will always be simpler and less powerful.
