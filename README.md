# Final Fantasy XIV Raid Planner

https://xivplan.netlify.app/

This is a tool for quickly diagramming raid strategies for Final Fantasy XIV,
inspired by [RaidPlan.io](https://raidplan.io).

## Alternatives

[RaidPlan.io](https://raidplan.io/ffxiv) now supports FFXIV.

[FF14 Toolbox Gaming Space](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space) is a more powerful
tool that supports animations and much more. Its UI is cumbersome to use though,
so it is not well suited to quickly diagramming during raids.
