# Final Fantasy XIV Raid Planner

https://xivplan.netlify.app/

This is a tool for quickly diagramming raid strategies for Final Fantasy XIV,
inspired by https://raidplan.io. Or at least it will be. It's not very quick to
use yet.

Check out https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space if you need something more powerful.
I'm creating this because the toolbox Strat Maker is too cumbersome to use during
progression, so it will always be simpler and less powerful.
