# ⚠⚠⚠ Please read this before asking for any instance or mechanic-related features ⚠⚠⚠

I do almost all content in this game without guides. You will probably see new raid bosses and mechanics before me, but **I don't want to know anything about any content I have not already cleared**.

You may discuss the following content:

* ✅ All content from Shadowbringers and earlier
* ✅ Patch 6.0-6.2 extreme trials
* ✅ Aglaia
* ✅ Asphodelos and Abyssos normal
* ✅ Savage 1st-7th circles
* ✅ All ultimates (if I do these at all, I don't do them blind)

Please do not discuss the following content:

❌ All Endwalker content that is not listed above

**Describe the feature:**
What would you like to be added?

If you'd like a new object type, please consider:

1. Is this a commonly reused mechanic?
2. Is there no way to approximate it using the already supported objects?

If you answered "yes" to both questions, it sounds like something I should add. If not, you can still ask, but I may not add it to keep XIVPlan simple.
